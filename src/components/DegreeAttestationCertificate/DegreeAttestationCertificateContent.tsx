        Attestation in Bangalore is crucial. Experienced attestation firms in
        Bangalore have a dedicated team that collects the documents from your
        doorstep, handles the attestation from start to finish, and ensures safe

        </a>{" "}
        generally starts with document verification at the university level. The
        original certificate is submitted along with a photocopy, passport copy,
        and authorization letter (if needed). The documents are then forwarded
        for State HRD attestation, which confirms the educational qualifications
        are genuine. Once the state attestation is done, the Ministry of
        External Affairs validates the certificate. Depending on the destination
        country, embassy or consulate attestation or Apostille is then affixed
        to the degree certificate. Apostille is accepted in Hague Convention
        member countries and is quicker than the traditional embassy route.
