      <h3>What is Embassy Attestation?</h3>
      <p>
        Embassy attestation is a process through which a document is
        authenticated by the concerned embassy of the destination country. It is
        a multi-step procedure that includes verification at several levels,
        such as:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>1. Notary Attestation</h6>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>2. Home Department/HRD Authentication</h6>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>3. Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Attestation</h6>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>4. Embassy Attestation</h6>
      </li>
      <p>
        This method is primarily used for countries that are not part of the
        <a href="https://foreignembassyattestation.com/apostille-services-in-bangalore">
          {" "}
          Hague Apostille Convention of 1961
        </a>
        . Popular non-Hague countries that require embassy attestation include
        the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, China, and
        Egypt, among others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Embassy attestation confirms that the document is genuine and has been
        reviewed and verified by both local and international authorities. It is
        a mandatory requirement for many non-Hague countries, especially when it
        comes to employment visas, higher education, or family relocation.
