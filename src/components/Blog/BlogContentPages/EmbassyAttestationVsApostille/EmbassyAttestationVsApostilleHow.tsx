      <h3>How to Choose Between Embassy Attestation and Apostille?</h3>
      <p>
        The best way to determine which process applies to you is to know where
        your documents will be submitted. Ask yourself the following:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>
          1. Is the destination country part of the Hague Apostille Convention?
        </h6>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>
          2. Does your employer or university have specific instructions
          regarding legalization?
        </h6>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>
          3. Are you dealing with government documentation (e.g., visa, PR) that
          requires official certification?
        </h6>
      </li>
      <p>
        If your answer points to a non-Hague country, youâ€™ll need{" "}
        <a href="https://foreignembassyattestation.com/">embassy attestation</a>
        . Otherwise, an apostille is sufficient.
