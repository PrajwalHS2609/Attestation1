      <h3>What is an Apostille?</h3>
      <p>
        An apostille is a form of document authentication issued for use in
        countries that are part of the Hague Apostille Convention of 1961. This
        process is much simpler and quicker than embassy attestation. An
        apostille stamp is issued by the{" "}

        </a>{" "}
        and affixed directly onto the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Countries that accept apostille include the United States, France,
        Germany, Australia, Italy, Spain, and over 120 other nations that are
        signatories to the Hague Convention. The apostille certifies the
        authenticity of the origin of the public document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a document is apostilled, it does not require any further
        attestation from the destination country's embassy or consulate.
