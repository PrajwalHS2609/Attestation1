                    Apostille services in Bangalore involve the authentication
                    of documents by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to
                    make them legally valid for use in countries that are
                    members of the Hague Convention.

                    Apostille is required to certify that a document issued in
                    India is genuine and acceptable in another Hague Convention
                    country. It eliminates the need for embassy attestation,
                    simplifying international document validation.
