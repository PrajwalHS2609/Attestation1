        The process of attestation involves getting the document verified by
        several levels of authorities, including notary, state-level
        departments, and the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). If the document
        is intended for use in a country that is a member of The Hague
        Convention, an apostille is issued by the MEA as a single-step
        certification that is internationally recognized among member nations.
        For countries outside this convention, a full attestation process is
        required, which can include embassy or consulate-level validation.
