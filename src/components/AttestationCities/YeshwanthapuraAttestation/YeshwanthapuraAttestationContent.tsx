        are tailored to meet the unique needs of students, working
        professionals, and business owners. These services ensure that your
        documents are legally accepted in foreign countries, whether you are
        applying for a visa, seeking admission into a university, or initiating
        overseas business deals. The process involves verifying the authenticity
        of a document at multiple levels, which may include notary attestation,
        state authentication, and embassy legalization depending on the country
        of destination. Apostille, on the other hand, is a simplified process
        accepted by countries that are members of The Hague Convention,
        eliminating the need for embassy legalization.
