        From educational certificates and birth or marriage registrations to
        commercial documents, each type of paperwork requires a specific process
        for attestation or apostille depending on the destination country.
        Apostille services are primarily needed for countries that are part of
        the Hague Convention, whereas attestation is necessary for non-member
        countries. In both scenarios,
