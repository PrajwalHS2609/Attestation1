        Understanding the difference between attestation and apostille is vital.
        Apostille is a streamlined form of document authentication accepted by
        countries that are members of the Hague Convention. If you're traveling
        to countries like{" "}

          Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)
        </a>{" "}
        is usually sufficient after state-level verification. On the other hand,
        attestation is required for countries not part of the Hague Convention,
        like the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, or Kuwait. In such cases, documents
        need to pass through several layers of verification, including the MEA
        and respective embassy or consulate.
