        Attestation involves verifying a document at multiple levels. It
        typically begins with notarization, followed by attestation from
        relevant state authorities, and finally from the{" "}

        . If your destination country is a member of the Hague Convention, then
        an apostille is sufficient instead of multiple attestation stamps. This

        over 100 countries. Navigating this process can be overwhelming, but
        with the help of expert Attestation & Apostille Services in Anekal, you
        can save time and avoid common mistakes.
