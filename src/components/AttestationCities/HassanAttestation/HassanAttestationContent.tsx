        Attestation & Apostille Services in Hassan help simplify this complex
        but crucial process. Attestation is the procedure of getting your
        documents validated by multiple authorities, usually required when
        you’re dealing with countries that are not part of the Hague Apostille
        Convention. These typically include countries like the UAE, Qatar, Saudi
        Arabia, and Kuwait. The attestation process involves state-level
        verification, followed by authentication from the{" "}
        <a href="https://foreignembassyattestation.com/mea-apostille-services-in-bangalore">
          Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)
        </a>
        , and finally, attestation by the foreign embassy or
        consulate.respective
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if you are traveling to a country that is a member of
        the Hague Convention, then you need apostille rather than full
        attestation. In this case, after the document is verified by the
        concerned state authority, the MEA provides an apostille sticker or
        stamp, which is recognized in all member countries.{" "}
