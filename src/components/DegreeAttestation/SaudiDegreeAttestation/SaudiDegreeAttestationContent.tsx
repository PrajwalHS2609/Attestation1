        standards required in the Kingdom. The attestation process is not merely
        a formality but a legal requirement to prove the legitimacy of your
        academic achievements. This step-by-step authentication involves

        employment or educational purposes.

        having valid identification proof, and submitting original documents
        along with passport copies and photographs. Some Saudi authorities may
        request Arabic translations of the documents, depending on their
