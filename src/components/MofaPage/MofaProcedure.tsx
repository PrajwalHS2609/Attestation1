          legally valid and accepted by foreign governments, institutions, and
          employers. In the case of personal documents, authentication is
          handled by the{" "}

          educational documents, the Education Department of the concerned State
          Government or Union Territory is responsible for authentication. The

          documents before forwarding them for further attestation.
