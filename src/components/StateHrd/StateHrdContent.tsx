          ensures the authenticity of educational documents, while the Home
          Department attestation validates personal certificates such as birth,
          marriage, and death certificates. Without proper attestation,
          documents may not be legally recognized by foreign authorities,
          embassies, or consulates, leading to potential delays in processing
          applications.

          . Every document intended for attestation or apostille must go through
          this process. Among all the state home departments, nearly 80% of
          document attestations are processed by the Maharashtra Home
          Department, commonly referred to as Mantralaya. Since Mantralaya
          attestation has been a widely accepted verification method from the
          very beginning, many embassies prefer this authentication.
          Additionally, for Indian consulate attestation, the home department of
          the state where the document was issued must provide attestation
          before proceeding with further verification.

          takes place at the state level.

          , while Saudi Arabia requires compulsory attestation from the state
          authorities before proceeding with embassy verification. When the
          responsibility was transferred to state governments, two exceptions
          were made for Kerala and Karnataka. These states introduced special
          authentication centers, known as Regional Authentication Centers

          vary based on the state and type of document. For example, in Tamil
          Nadu, documents undergo university verification, and processing time
          depends on the institution and the age of the document. In contrast,
          Kerala typically completes the attestation process within a day. The
          cost of attestation also varies, as some universities charge a fee for
          verification, which may increase depending on the age of the document
          and specific university policies. In Maharashtra, the attestation
          process follows the regulations set by the State Home Department.
