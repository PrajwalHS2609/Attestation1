      <p>
        A visa is a conditional authorization granted by a country to a
        foreigner, allowing them to enter, remain within, or to leave that
        country. Visas typically include limits on the duration of the
        foreigner's stay, territory within the country they may enter, the dates
        they may enter, the number of permitted visits or an individual's right
        to work in the country in question. Visas are associated with the
        request for permission to enter a country and thus are, in some
        countries, distinct from actual formal permission for an alien to enter
        and remain in the country. In each instance, a visa is subject to entry
        permission by an immigration official at the time of actual entry, and
        can be revoked at any time.
