        level. This may involve verification by the school, college, or
        university that issued the certificate. After the educational
        institution validates your documents, they are then authenticated by the
        relevant state authorities such as the State Education Department or
        <a href="https://foreignembassyattestation.com/state-hrd-attestation-in-bangalore">
